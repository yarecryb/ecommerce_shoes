### Project Description

We are creating an e-commerce platform where users can buy and sell shoes. Users create an account with an email and password where passwords are encrypted in our database. Users can create a new listing and upload images for each item. Users can search for which items they want to buy and filter by shoe size, brand, price, username, and date uploaded.
